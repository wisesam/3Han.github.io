[**1. Library System**](https://wise4edu.com/wlibrary/inst/wise4edu)
  - This is a simple library system for schools, organizaitons, and even individuals.
  - It supports E-libray as well as conventional library with patron management

  - It's in Beta testing phase right now, so if you want to try just send me an email, I will set up a test account for you.

  - It will be shared as an open source project later.
  
  
[**2. Magic Initials**](https://wise4edu.com/init/)
  - This app is to help people to memorize their favorate proverbs, sayings, lyrics, bible verses, and even long texts like speeches or an entire chapter of the Bible.
  - We call them "Treasures". :)

  - It's in draft version yet but will be improved with many interesting features like games to boost memorization.
