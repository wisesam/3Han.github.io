## These are two of my projects that you might be interested in
[**1. Library System**](https://wise4edu.com/wlibrary/inst/wise4edu)
  - This is a simple library system for schools, organizaitons, and even individuals.
  - It supports e-libray as well as conventional library with patron management.
  - It can be integrated with School ERP like [WISE V2](https://wise4edu.com).
  - It's in Beta testing phase right now, so if you want to try just send me an email, I will set up a test account for you.
  - It was made by Laravel and our own framework called **VWMLDBM: Visual Web Multi-Lang DB Manager**.
  - It will be shared as an open source project later.
  
  
[**2. Magic Initials**](https://wise4edu.com/init/)
  - This app is to help people to memorize their favorate proverbs, sayings, lyrics, bible verses, and even long texts like a speech and an entire chapter of the Bible.
  - We call them "Treasures". :)
  - The special method is based on "Intitials Method" invented by Mr. Daniel Oh.
  - It is a draft version yet but will be improved with many interesting features like games to boost memorization.
  - You can try some of the shared treaures and also sign up to post you treasures (You can have your secret treausre).
